# GmailCleaner
Deletes all the email in your gmail. This was made to clean my inbox but I thought why not put it on git since it's very common to get spammed by places like youtube and facebook or even other subscription. If your looking for something that will clean your entire gmail inbox this might be of help.
Also make sure to add nuget pakage of gmail by typing "Install-Package Google.Apis.Gmail.v1" in ur Pakage Manager Console.
